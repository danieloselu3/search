# Search
Search is an implentation of the Google Search UI, it allows a user to search the Internet.(A project from *Havard's web development using python and Javascript at EDX.com*)

## proect pages
The project consists of three pages, **Google Search**(_where you can type a word and search_), **Google Image Search**(_where you type in a word and the image results of the search word is returned_), **Google Advanced Search**(_where you can custom your searches_).

## project tech stack
The page is developed using **HTML, CSS and SASS**, and all the forms in the page use actual google links, hence requests are sent to the google server, enabling us to implement an actual search engine without any backend technology.
